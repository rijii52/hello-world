# hello-world
Traditional very first 'Hello, world" project

This project is just to start with this amazing new (for me) tool where I'm planning to make a lot new and interesting project.
Since I used a lot of various source control tools at the past it shouldn't be a problem to lean this one too.
Good luck.
